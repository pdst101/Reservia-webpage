Turn Mock-ups Into a Web Page


Features

Users will be able to search for accommodations in the city of their choice. Therefore, the search field is an input field, the text of which can be edited by the user. However, at this stage, the search button will not be functional.
Each accommodation or activity card will have to be clickable in its entirety. For the moment, the links will be empty.
The filters will not be functional for this version; however, they must change their appearance when hovered over. I leave it up to you to decide the most appropriate effect.
In the menu, the Accommodations and Activities links are anchors that should lead to sections of the page.
 

Technical constraints

I’m providing you with two mock-ups: one desktop and one mobile. The site will also have to be adapted for tablets. You are free to make the necessary adaptations with the layout, as long as no elements are cut, and the text is a sufficient size. I’ll let you choose the appropriate breakpoints.
As I didn't know which image sizes and formats you need, I exported a variety. I’ll let you choose the most suitable format concerning resolution and loading time.
The icons come from the Font Awesome library. The colors of the chart are blue #0065FC and its lighter version #DEEBFF, as well as grey for the background #F2F2.
The site font is Raleway.


• Don't use a framework for this project: since you are just starting out, I prefer that  you sharpen your skills using HTML and CSS and learn to code from scratch. We want to test your skills on that!

• I recommend using Visual Studio Code. The plugins can make your life easier (for example, Live Server or Prettier).

• You can integrate Font Awesome icons in HTML or CSS. I strongly advise you to use Flexbox, but you can also use CSS Grid if you want.

• Your code will have to use semantic tags and not contain any errors or warnings when running it through the W3C HTML and CSS validator.

• The site should be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox.

• Remember to separate HTML and CSS and to organize your folders accordingly.

• Don't forget to version your code with Git from the beginning! It will help your team track your work.  And you need to deploy the page on GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages (your choice which one).
